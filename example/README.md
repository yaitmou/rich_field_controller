# RichFieldController example project

Demonstrates how to use the `RichFieldController` package

## Getting Started

In this project we are using a standard `TextField` with a `RichFieldController`. We have also added toolbar to illustrate how you could build a custom toolbar and invoke the `RichFieldController`'s main method `void setStyle(TextStyle textStyle)`.
